												G1 PROCESS (named pipe)
													
This process will generate short message which is composed by a time stamp, the process identifier, and a little datum identyfying the message itself: 

											struct message {time_t timestamp; char g; int x);

where, 

timestamp is the actual time (by a suitable syscall)
g is a character identifying G1 process
x is the sequence number of the message by G1 process	

In this process, message is generated inside a strict loop  (the fastest possible); at any cycle a delay is applied before sending the message. The delay is computed as follows:

											delay [microseconds] = offset + random(0,offset); 
The struct message,delay and number of cycles sent to process R from G1 by means of a named pipe(mkfifo,"g1").											
where,

random(0,offset) is a random generator in the interval 0 â€“ offset with uniform probability
offset is a parameter that must be changed in the experiment		

This simplified model simulates the generation of quasi-periodic messages by a sensor at variable rate (depending on the value of offset).

This will communicate with R process through named pipes.
